          # An account-level budget. It contains information about the budget itself,
          # as well as the most recently approved changes to the budget and proposed
          # changes that are pending approval. The proposed changes that are pending
          # approval, if any, are found in 'pending_proposal'.  Effective details about
          # the budget are found in fields prefixed 'approved_', 'adjusted_' and those
          # without a prefix.  Since some effective details may differ from what the user
          # had originally requested (e.g. spending limit), these differences are
          # juxtaposed via 'proposed_', 'approved_', and possibly 'adjusted_' fields.
          #
          # This resource is mutated using AccountBudgetProposal and cannot be mutated
          # directly. A budget may have at most one pending proposal at any given time.
          # It is read through pending_proposal.
          #
          # Once approved, a budget may be subject to adjustments, such as credit
          # adjustments.  Adjustments create differences between the 'approved' and
          # 'adjusted' fields, which would otherwise be identical.
