          # An ad parameter that is used to update numeric values (such as prices or
          # inventory levels) in any text line of an ad (including URLs). There can
          # be a maximum of two AdParameters per ad group criterion. (One with
          # parameter_index = 1 and one with parameter_index = 2.)
          # In the ad the parameters are referenced by a placeholder of the form
          # "\\{param#:value}". E.g. "\\{param1:$17}"
          # @!attribute [rw] resource_name
          #   @return [String]
          #     Immutable. The resource name of the ad parameter.
          #     Ad parameter resource names have the form:
          #
          #     `customers/{customer_id}/adParameters/{ad_group_id}~{criterion_id}~{parameter_index}`
          # @!attribute [rw] ad_group_criterion
          #   @return [Google::Protobuf::StringValue]
          #     Immutable. The ad group criterion that this ad parameter belongs to.
          # @!attribute [rw] parameter_index
          #   @return [Google::Protobuf::Int64Value]
          #     Immutable. The unique index of this ad parameter. Must be either 1 or 2.
          # @!attribute [rw] insertion_text
          #   @return [Google::Protobuf::StringValue]
          #     Numeric value to insert into the ad text. The following restrictions
          #      apply:
          #      - Can use comma or period as a separator, with an optional period or
          #        comma (respectively) for fractional values. For example, 1,000,000.00
          #        and 2.000.000,10 are valid.
          #      - Can be prepended or appended with a currency symbol. For example,
          #        $99.99 is valid.
          #      - Can be prepended or appended with a currency code. For example, 99.99USD
          #        and EUR200 are valid.
          #      - Can use '%'. For example, 1.0% and 1,0% are valid.
          #      - Can use plus or minus. For example, -10.99 and 25+ are valid.
          #      - Can use '/' between two numbers. For example 4/1 and 0.95/0.45 are
          #        valid.
