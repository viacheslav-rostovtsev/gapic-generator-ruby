          #     Campaign budget resource names have the form:

          #
          #     A campaign budget is created using the CampaignBudgetService create
          #     operation and is assigned a budget ID. A budget ID can be shared across
          #     different campaigns; the system will then allocate the campaign budget
          #     among different campaigns to get optimum results.
          # @!attribute [rw] name
          #   @return [Google::Protobuf::StringValue]
          #     The name of the campaign budget.
          #
          #     When creating a campaign budget through CampaignBudgetService, every
          #     explicitly shared campaign budget must have a non-null, non-empty name.
          #     Campaign budgets that are not explicitly shared derive their name from the
          #     attached campaign's name.
          #
          #     The length of this string must be between 1 and 255, inclusive,

          # @!attribute [rw] amount_micros
          #   @return [Google::Protobuf::Int64Value]
          #     The amount of the budget, in the local currency for the account.
          #     Amount is specified in micros, where one million is equivalent to one
          #     currency unit. Monthly spend is capped at 30.4 times this amount.

          #   @return [Google::Protobuf::Int64Value]

          #     is spent.

          #     unspecified in a create operation.
          #
          #     If true, the budget was created with the purpose of sharing
          #     across one or more campaigns.
          #
          #     If false, the budget was created with the intention of only being used
          #     with a single campaign. The budget's name and status will stay in sync
          #     with the campaign's name and status. Attempting to share the budget with a
          #     second campaign will result in an error.
          #
          #     A non-shared budget can become an explicitly shared. The same operation
          #     must also assign the budget a name.
