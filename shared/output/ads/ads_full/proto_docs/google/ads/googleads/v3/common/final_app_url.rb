          #     corresponds to the content you'd like to show, and should be of the form
          #     \\{scheme}://\\{host_path}
          #     The scheme identifies which app to open. For your app, you can use a custom
          #     scheme that starts with the app's name. The host and path specify the
          #     unique location in the app where your content exists.
          #     Example: "exampleapp://productid_1234". Required.
